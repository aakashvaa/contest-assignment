Build a Contest Tracker that fetches all the upcoming contests from Codeforces, CodeChef, and Leetcode. Make sure to show the date of the contest and time remaining before starting. Also show the past contests.

1. Have a filter to allow the users to select contests from only 1 or more platforms. Eg: Only from Codeforces, or from Codeforces + Leetcode.

2. Allow the user to bookmark a contest.

3. Have a way to populate the link to the contest solution from our Youtube channel of a past contest. A separate URL which contains a form where somebody from our team can select the contest and attach the corresponding link from our channel.

Here are the links to the playlist on our Youtube:

- Leetcode PCDs
- Codeforces PCDs
- Codechef PCDs

**Bonus:**

- Automatically fetch the links from Youtube and add them once the solution is uploaded without requiring a person to do it manually.
- Add basic documentation for the code.
- Bonus: UI is mobile and tablet responsive.
- Have both light and dark mode with a toggle option.
- Code is well documented.
